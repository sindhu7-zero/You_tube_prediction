🔍 Project Overview

As video creators and media companies increasingly rely on platforms like YouTube for income, predicting potential ad revenue becomes essential for business planning and content strategy. This project builds and compares multiple regression models to estimate daily ad_revenue_usd for a video, then exposes the best model via a Streamlit web app with basic analytics.

Key Goals

Clean and model a ~122k‑row synthetic dataset (CSV) of daily video performance.

Compare at least 5 regression models and pick a champion based on R², RMSE, MAE.

Ship a Streamlit app for interactive predictions + simple visual insights.

Produce clear EDA, feature engineering, documentation, and reliable code.

Tech Stack: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit‑learn, Streamlit, Matplotlib/Plotly
